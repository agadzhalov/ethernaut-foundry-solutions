/// @title Solution to Preservation Ethernaut challenge
/// @notice Solution: 
///         1. It's crucial to understand how storage and slots work.
///         2. `timeZone1Library` can be changed by executing `setTime` because they share the same storage slot.
///         3. First, we deploy a malicious contract with variables and slots corresponding to `Preservation`.
///         4. The address of the malicious contract needs to be converted to `uint256` to match the slot type, 
///            as `uint256` occupies 32 bytes, while an address occupies only 20 bytes.
///         5. We execute `preservation.setFirstTime()` with the malicious contractâ€™s address (as `uint256`), and any 
///            subsequent calls to `setTime` will make `msg.sender` the new owner.
